💡 Why I Built This App

Blood donation is one of the simplest ways to save lives, yet countless people still struggle to find donors in time of emergency. I built this app to bridge that gap between blood donors and those in urgent need through technology. The goal is to make the donation process faster, easier, and location-aware — helping users request blood instantly, and enabling nearby donors to respond without delay. This project reflects my passion for using Flutter and Firebase to solve real-world problems and create an impact that truly matters.
